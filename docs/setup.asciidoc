== Setup

Download and install Java {java-version} or greater from https://java.com/en/download/; if
you're on a GNU/Linux distribution, install Java through your package manager.

After Java has been installed, make sure that the `java` command is available
in the system path by opening a terminal window and running `java -version`;
the command should display the version of Java installed on your system.

You can set up Kibana and start exploring your Elasticsearch indices in minutes.
All you need is:

* Elasticsearch 2.3 or later
* A modern web browser - http://www.elastic.co/subscriptions/matrix#matrix_browsers[Supported Browsers].
* Information about your Elasticsearch installation:
** URL of the Elasticsearch instance you want to connect to.
** Which Elasticsearch indices you want to search.

NOTE: If your Elasticsearch installation is protected by http://www.elastic.co/overview/shield/[Shield] see
{shield}/kibana.html#using-kibana4-with-shield[Shield with Kibana 4] for additional setup instructions.

Download the Kibi binary distribution from http://siren.solutions/kibi and
extract it to a local directory.

To start the Elasticsearch cluster included in the distribution, open a
terminal window, change to the directory where you extracted Kibi and run
the following command:

[source,shell]
----
$ cd elasticsearch/
$ ./bin/elasticsearch
----

If you're on Windows, run the following command:

[source,shell]
----
$ cd elasticsearch\
$ .\bin\elasticsearch.bat
----

To start Kibi, open a second terminal window, change to the directory where you
extracted Kibi and run the following command:

[[kibana-dynamic-mapping]]
==== Kibi and Elasticsearch Dynamic Mapping
By default, Elasticsearch enables {elastic-ref}dynamic-mapping.html[dynamic mapping] for fields. Kibi needs dynamic mapping
to use fields in visualizations correctly, as well as to manage the `.kibana` index where saved searches,
visualizations, and dashboards are stored.

If your Elasticsearch use case requires you to disable dynamic mapping, you need to manually provide mappings for
fields that Kibana uses to create visualizations. You also need to manually enable dynamic mapping for the `.kibana`
index.

The following procedure assumes that the `.kibi` index does not already exist in Elasticsearch and that the
`index.mapper.dynamic` setting in `elasticsearch.yml` is set to `false`:

. Start Elasticsearch.
. Create the `.kibana` index with dynamic mapping enabled just for that index:
+
[source,shell]
----
$ cd kibi/
$ ./bin/kibi
----

If you're on Windows, run the following command:

[source,shell]
----
$ cd kibi\
$ .\bin\kibi.bat
----

Upon first launch, the Windows firewall might display the following dialog
box; to allow the Kibi backend to connect to external datasources, please
check both check boxes (as shown below) and press the *Allow access* button.

Kibi can be accessed by visiting {start-url} or for installation with Shield visiting {start-url-shield};
an overview of the included demo dataset is available in
<<getting_started, Getting started>> section.

If you want to connect Kibi to a different Elasticsearch cluster, open
the configuration file in `kibi/config/kibi.yml`, set the correct URL in
the `elasticsearch.url` parameter, then restart Kibi.

[[connect]]
=== Connect Kibi with Elasticsearch
Before you can start using Kibana, you need to tell it which Elasticsearch indices you want to explore. The first time
you access Kibana, you are prompted to define an _index pattern_ that matches the name of one or more of your indices.
That's it. That's all you need to configure to start using Kibana. You can add index patterns at any time from the
<<settings-create-pattern,Settings tab>>.

TIP: By default, Kibana connects to the Elasticsearch instance running on `localhost`. To connect to a different
Elasticsearch instance, modify the Elasticsearch URL in the `kibana.yml` configuration file and restart Kibana. For
information about using Kibana with your production nodes, see <<production>>.

To configure the Elasticsearch indices you want to access with Kibana:

. Point your browser at port 5601 to access the Kibana UI. For example, `localhost:5601` or `http://YOURDOMAIN.com:5601`.
+
image:images/Start-Page.png[Kibana start page]
+
. Specify an index pattern that matches the name of one or more of your Elasticsearch indices. By default, Kibana
guesses that you're working with data being fed into Elasticsearch by Logstash. If that's the case, you can use the
default `logstash-*` as your index pattern. The asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters in an index's name. If
your Elasticsearch indices follow some other naming convention, enter an appropriate pattern. The "pattern" can also
simply be the name of a single index.
. Select the index field that contains the timestamp that you want to use to perform time-based comparisons. Kibana
reads the index mapping to list all of the fields that contain a timestamp. If your index doesn't have time-based data,
disable the *Index contains time-based events* option.
+
WARNING: Using event times to create index names is *deprecated* in this release of Kibana. Support for this functionality
will be removed entirely in the next major Kibana release. Elasticsearch 2.1 includes sophisticated date parsing APIs that
Kibana uses to determine date information, removing the need to specify dates in the index pattern name.
+
. Click *Create* to add the index pattern. This first pattern is automatically configured as the default.
When you have more than one index pattern, you can designate which one to use as the default from *Settings > Indices*.

Voila! Kibana is now connected to your Elasticsearch data. Kibana displays a read-only list of fields configured for
the matching index.

[[kibi-dynamic-mapping]]
=== Kibi and Elasticsearch Dynamic Mapping
By default, Elasticsearch enables  {elastic-ref}mapping.html#_dynamic_mapping[dynamic mapping] for fields.
Kibi needs dynamic mapping to use fields in visualizations correctly, as well
as to manage the `.kibi` index where all its configuration is stored.

If your Elasticsearch use case requires you to disable dynamic mapping, you
need to manually provide mappings for fields that Kibi uses to create
visualizations.

You also need to manually enable dynamic mapping for the `.kibi` index.

The following procedure assumes that the `.kibi` index does not already exist
in Elasticsearch and that the `index.mapper.dynamic` setting in
`elasticsearch.yml` is set to `false`:

- Start Elasticsearch.

- Create the `.kibi` index with dynamic mapping enabled:

[source,shell]
curl -X PUT <your Elasticsearch URL>/.kibi -d '{ "index.mapper.dynamic": true }'

- Start Kibi, open the UI in your browser and verify that there are no
error messages related to dynamic mapping.
For a brief tutorial that explores these core Kibi concepts, take a look at the <<getting-started, Getting
Started>> page.
