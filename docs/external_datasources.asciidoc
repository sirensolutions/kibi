[[external_datasources]]
= External Datasources

{kibi-name} provides visualizations and aggregations to integrate data from external
datasources. This section explains how to setup datasources and configure
<<datasource-queries, queries>> and <<datasource-templates, query templates>>.

[float]
== Configuration

To create a new external datasource navigate to "Settings/Datasources"
First fill the datasource title and name then pick one of the types
{kibi-name} supports:

* REST
* SQLite
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL

After selecting the datasource type, additional parameters will appear.
Below is a list of additional mandatory parameters for each datasource type:

*Common Parameters*

* timeout - connection timeout in milliseconds
* cache_enabled - enable server side cache for this datasource
* max_age - the max age of an object in the cache, in milliseconds

To control the maximum number of query results kept in cache, set the `kibi_core.datasource_cache_size` parameter in siren.yml.

[NOTE]
A {kibi-name} restart is required to apply changes to siren.yml configuration file.

*REST*

* url - an URL of rest API endpoint
* response_type - API results format, currently {kibi-name} supports only *JSON*
* username (optional) - username with access to the API
* password (optional) - corresponding password
* auth_token (optional) - token used in Token Authentication

*SQLite*

* db_file_path - path to database file

*MySQL, PostgreSQL*

* host - hostname
* dbname - database name
* username - username with read access to the database
* password - corresponding password

== Parameters encryption

Sensitive datasource parameters like passwords are encrypted before being
stored in the `.kibi` index.

Before creating datasources containing sensitive parameters, make sure to set
a custom encryption key by running the `replace_encryption_key` command:

[source,bash]
----
bin/investigate replace_encryption_key [options] <current_key> <new_key> <new_cipher>
----

* **<current_key>** a base64 encoded string containing the current encryption key.
* **<new_key>** a base64 encoded string containing the new encryption key.
* **<new_cipher>** the cipher algorithm to use (currently only AES-GCM is supported).

The current encryption key can be read from the `siren.yml` file in the
`datasource_encryption_key` parameter.

Keys can have a length of 16, 24 or 32 bytes; a quick way to encode a plaintext
string to base64 is to use the `base64` utility from the coreutils package:

[source,bash]
----
$ echo -n changemechangemechangemechangeme | base64
Y2hhbmdlbWVjaGFuZ2VtZWNoYW5nZW1lY2hhbmdlbWU=
----

NOTE: Make sure to set the configuration file as readable only by the user
running the {kibi-name} process.

[[entity_selection]]
== Datasource entity selection

Selected Entities can be used to as source of parameters for queries
Each selected entity is uniquely identified by an URI:

- `INDEX/TYPE/ID` where INDEX is an index pattern, TYPE is a type of a document, and ID is document ID

As explained in the following sections, queries on external datasources can
extract variables from the selected entity URI; in order to allow the user
to select an entity, you must add an <<enhanced_search_results>> visualization
to a dashboard and configure at least one <<click-handlers, click handler>>
to select an entity.

Once the visualization is configured, clicking on the cell will display
a purple box in the filter bar, and the variables stored in the entity URI
will be available to queries and query templates.

The screenshot below shows the effect of clicking on a cell configured with an
entity selection handler; after selecting an entity, the _Company Info_
template viewer shows the information about the company fetched by a query.

To disable or cancel the selection, click on the icons displayed inside the
entity selection widget when the mouse is over it, as displayed in the
screenshot below:

[float]
[[datasource-queries]]
== Queries

Queries can be used to provide data to <<datasource-templates>>,
<<relational-column, tag>> and filter Elasticsearch documents.

To create a new query, click to the _"Settings/Queries"_ tab.

You need then to set the following fields to define a query:

* _Title_: the title of the query.
* _Datasource_: the name of a configured datasource.
* _Results query_: the query declaration.

You may also set a description for the query and one or more tags.

Below is an example configuration of a query on a SQL database
called *Top 50 companies (HR count)* that returns the Top 50 companies by
number of employees in a table called `company`.

image::images/external_sources/queries_editor_sql1.png["Configuration of a SQL endpoint",align="center"]

The preview section will display the results of the query as a table or as a
JSON object.

NOTE: Template rendering is currently a blocking operation, therefore queries returning a large number of results might make the backend unresponsive for an indeterminate amount of time.

[float]
[[query-variables]]
=== Query variables:

One of the most useful features of queries is that it is possible to set some
of their parameters before execution by using datasource specific variables,
which can be set at runtime by configuring <<click-handlers, click handlers>>
in the <<enhanced_search_results>> visualization to select an entity.

Variable values are taken from elasticsearch document selected via selected entity URI.

All properties from selected document can be accessed using the following syntax:
_@doc[PATH_ELEMENT_1][PATH_ELEMENT_2]...[PATH_ELEMENT_N]@_

- to get the document id use:
  *@doc[_id]@*
- to get the value of property called *action* use:
  *@doc[_source][action]@*
  - to get the value of nested property called *person.age* use:
    *@doc[_source][person][age]@*


In order to view the results of the query, you have to specify an entity URI
manually in the field on the top right;

Below is an example of configuration for a query named *Company Info* using
a variable to get the value of property called *id* of currently selected entity
In the example, _@doc[_source][id]@_ is replaced with an id taken from selected company.
In the Selected Entity box we see that the selected company is
from index: *company*, has a type: *Company* and has the id *AVgfaYQ0Q2VQXwxDgyfY*

[float]
[[activation-query]]
=== Activation Query

An activation query can be specified to conditionally execute the results
query.

For example, if you have a table called _Vehicles_ but some of the queries are
only relevant to "Motorcycles" and not to "Cars", the activation query could
be used to determine if the results query should be executed when an entity in
_Vehicles_ by looking at its type.
If the query is not executed, any template or aggregator using the query
will be automatically disabled.

On SQL datasources, activation queries will trigger results query execution
when returning at least one record.

Example:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT id
FROM Vehicles
WHERE id='@doc[_source][id]@' AND vehicle_type='Motorcycle'
----

[float]
[[datasource-uses]]
== Use cases

Once you've configured query templates and queries, you can use them
in the following visualizations:

- The <<enhanced_search_results>> visualization
- The <<kibi_query_viewer>> visualization

It is also possible to use queries as aggregations as explained below.

[float]
[[external-query-terms-filter-aggregation]]
=== External query terms filters aggregation

The query results from an external data source can be used as an aggregation
in visualizations.

This allows to compute metrics on Elasticsearch documents _joined_ with query
results.

To use a query as an aggregation, select a bucket type and select
_External Query Terms Filter_ in the _Aggregation_ dropdown; then, click on
the _Add an external query terms filter_ button.

You can then configure how to join the query results with the Elasticsearch
documents by setting the following parameters:

- _Source query id_: the name of the query on the external datasource.
- _Source query variable_: the name of the variable in query results
which contains the first value used in the join.
- _Target field_: the name of the field in the target index which contains
the second value used in the join.

The aggregation will return only documents in the Elasticsearch index whose
target field value is equal to the source query variable value in at least
one of the results returned by the query; if _Negate the query_ is checked,
the aggregation will return only documents in the Elasticsearch index whose
target field value is not equal to any of the values of the source query
variable in the results returned by the query.

For example, the screenshot below show the configuration of a Data table
visualization with three aggregations based on external queries:

- A query that selects the labels of the competitors of the currently selected
company
- A query that selects the labels of all the companies which have a competitor
- A query that selects the id's of the top 500 companies by number of employees

If a query requires a selected entity, and no entity is selected, the
computed aggregation will return 0, also the controls to select *Selected entity*
will indicate (red borders arround) that it is necessary to select one.
