=== Kibi Word Cloud

The Kibi Wordcloud visualization displays the most frequent terms in the
current set of Elasticsearch documents at a glance.

To configure the visualization, select *Count* as the aggregation for the
metric, then add a *Split Rows* bucket configuration; you can choose to process
terms using either the {elastic-ref}search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html[Terms]
aggregation or the {elastic-ref}search-aggregations-bucket-significantterms-aggregation.html[Significant Terms]
aggregation.

==== Using the terms aggregation

If the bucket aggregation is set to *Terms*, you need to specify the following
parameters:

- *Field*: the field which will provide terms to be aggregated.
- *Order* and *Size*: the subset and number of terms to be
aggregated.
- *Order By*: the metric used to sort the terms.

For example, to display the Top 30 terms by count in the `snippet` field
of an index containing articles, set the following configuration:

To exclude common words or any unwanted term, click on *Advanced* and
and write a regular expression in the *Exclude pattern* field:
