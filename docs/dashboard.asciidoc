[[dashboard]]
== Dashboard

A Kibi _dashboard_ displays a set of saved visualizations in a customizable
grid layout. You can save a dashboard to share or reload at a later time.

In Kibi, dashboards are displayed as tabs and can be organized as <<dashboard-groups, dashboard groups>>.

=== Getting Started

You need at least one saved <<visualize, visualization>> to use a dashboard.

[[creating-a-new-dashboard]]
==== Building a New Dashboard

The first time you click the *Dashboard* tab, Kibi displays the first available
dashboard or, if no dashboards have been defined, the dashboard creation screen.

Build your dashboard by adding visualizations. By default, Kibana dashboards use a light color theme. To use a dark color
theme instead, click the *Settings* image:images/SettingsButton.jpg[Gear] button and check the *Use dark theme* box.

NOTE: You can change the default theme in the *Advanced* section of the *Settings* tab.

==== Saving Dashboards

To save the dashboard, click the *Save Dashboard* image:images/SaveVis.png[Save]
button:

image::images/dashboard/save_dashboard.png["Saving a dashboard",align="center"]

The name of the dashboard can be set in the *Save As* field.

If *Store time with dashboard* is checked, the time filter currently set will
be restored when the dashboard is opened.

To display the number of Elasticsearch documents displayed by the dashboard
in the corresponding tab, select a *Saved Search*:

[[sharing-dashboards]]
==== Sharing Dashboards

You can share dashboards with other users by sending a link or by embedding
them into HTML pages; make sure that your Kibi installation is properly secured
when sharing a dashboard on a public facing server.

NOTE: To view shared dashboards users must be able to access Kibi; keep
this in mind if your Kibi instance is protected by an authentication proxy.

To share a dashboard, click the *Share* button image:images/share-dashboard.png[] to display the _Sharing_ panel.


image:images/sharing-panel.png[]

Click the *Copy to Clipboard* button image:images/share-link.png[] to copy the native URL or embed HTML to the clipboard.
Click the *Generate short URL* button image:images/share-short-link.png[] to create a shortened URL for sharing or
embedding.

[float]
[[embedding-dashboards]]
==== Embedding Dashboards

To embed a dashboard, copy the embed code from the _Share_ display into your external web application.

[float]
[[adding-visualizations-to-a-dashboard]]
==== Adding Visualizations to a Dashboard

To add a visualization to the dashboard, click the *Add Visualization* image:images/AddVis.png[Plus]
button in the toolbar panel, then select a previously created visualization
from the list:

image::images/dashboard/add_vis.png["Adding a visualization to the dashboard",align="center"]

You can filter the list of visualizations by typing a filter string into the
*Visualization Filter* field.

The visualization you select appears in a _container_ on your dashboard.

NOTE: If you see a message about the container's height or width being too
small, <<resizing-containers,resize the container>>.

[float]
==== Reset all dashboards to their default state

One can save with dashboard some specific filters, a custom query or a certain time range.
If you click on the *Reset the time, filters, and queries from all dashboards to their default saved state* image:images/remove-all-filters.png[Minus] button in the toolbar panel, the temporary filters/queries/time set on **all** dashboards would be removed, reverted to a dashboard's default state with the saved filters/query/time.

NOTE: If the <<relational-panel,relational panel>> is <<relations-settings-enable,enabled>>, clicking this button does not remove the <<relational-panel-browsing,filter>>. If you want to do so, you need to disable the relational panel in the <<kibi-settings-relations,Relations settings>>.

[float]
[[customizing-your-dashboard]]
=== Customizing Dashboard Elements

The visualizations in your dashboard are stored in resizable _containers_ that
you can arrange on the dashboard. This section discusses customizing these
containers.

[float]
[[moving-containers]]
==== Moving Containers

Click and hold a container's header to move the container around the dashboard. Other containers will shift as needed
to make room for the moving container. Release the mouse button to confirm the container's new location.

[float]
[[resizing-containers]]
==== Resizing Containers

Move the cursor to the bottom right corner of the container until the cursor changes to point at the corner. After the
cursor changes, click and drag the corner of the container to change the container's size. Release the mouse button to
confirm the new container size.

[float]
[[removing-containers]]
==== Removing Containers

Click the *x* icon at the top right corner of a container to remove that container from the dashboard. Removing a
container from a dashboard does not delete the saved visualization in that container.

[float]
[[viewing-detailed-information]]
==== Viewing Detailed Information

To display the raw data behind the visualization, click the bar at the bottom of the container. Tabs with detailed
information about the raw data replace the visualization, as in this example:

.Table
A representation of the underlying data, presented as a paginated data grid. You can sort the items
in the table by clicking on the table headers at the top of each column.

image:images/NYCTA-Table.jpg[]

.Request
The raw request used to query the server, presented in JSON format.

image:images/NYCTA-Request.jpg[]

.Response
The raw response from the server, presented in JSON format.

image:images/NYCTA-Response.jpg[]

.Statistics
A summary of the statistics related to the request and the response, presented as a data grid. The data
grid includes the query duration, the request duration, the total number of records found on the server, and the
index pattern used to make the query.

image:images/NYCTA-Statistics.jpg[]

To export the raw data behind the visualization as a comma-separated-values (CSV) file, click on either the
*Raw* or *Formatted* links at the bottom of any of the detailed information tabs. A raw export contains the data as it
is stored in Elasticsearch. A formatted export contains the results of any applicable Kibana [field formatters].

[[changing-the-visualization]]
=== Changing the Visualization

Click the _Edit_ button image:images/EditVis.png[Pencil button] at the top right of a container to open the
visualization in the <<visualize,Visualize>> page.

[float]
[[dashboard-groups]]
=== Dashboard Groups

Dashboards can be organized in dashboard groups; dashboard groups are displayed
as tabs just like dashboards.

Clicking on a dashboard group will display the first dashboard in the group
by default; the other dashboards in the group can be selected through the
dropdown menu embedded in the tab:

image::images/dashboard/dashboardgroup_tab.png["A dashboard group tab",align="center"]

If the dashboard is associated with a saved search the count of documents on the dashboard is displayed next to the dashboard name.
Two additional indicators that might be displayed are:

* _Filters/Queries indicator_ - the filter icon is displayed if there are any filter or query on the dashboard
* _Pruned joins indicator_ - a star symbol is displayed if any of the join operations was pruned

An example image below was taken on the *Articles detailed per source* dashboard.
By opening the select dropdown, we see that there are 7225 documents on *Articles* dashboard.
We also know that there are some filters or queries on this dashboard
and at least one of the join operations was pruned.

image::images/dashboard/dashboard_counts_and_indicators.png["A dashboard counts and indicators",align="center"]


Dashboard groups can be managed by clicking on the
<<kibi-settings-dashboards-groups,Dashboard Groups Settings>> tab.
