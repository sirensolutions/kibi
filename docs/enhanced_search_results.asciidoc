=== Enhanced search results

Enhanced search results is a visualisation that shows the documents matched by
a query on an Elasticsearch index, similar to the Kibana Discover table.

In addition to column configuration, the visualization provides the following
features:

- it is possible to enable a column that indicates whether or not a search
result is matched by a query on an external datasource. This is described in
<<relational-column>>.
- it is possible to define click handlers on the cells in a column, e.g.
to open the URL displayed in a cell. This is described in <<click-handlers>>.

[[relational-column]]
==== Relational Column

The relational column can be used to display if a search result is matched
by a query on an external datasource.

To enable the relational column, check the _Enable Relational Column_ checkbox.

The screenshot below shows the configuration of a relational column named
_Why Relevant?_ where the value of a cell depends on the query
_Top 50 companies (HR count)_: if the value of the _label_ *index field* of a
document matches the value of the _label_ variable in at least one record
returned by the query, the name of the query will be displayed inside the cell.

In order to configure the relational column, you must set the following
parameters:

- _Column name_: the column name that will be displayed in the table header.
- _Source Field_: the name of the index field that will be compared to a
variable in the query results.
- _Target query_: the name of the query to execute.
- _Target query variable name_: the name of the query variable that will be
compared to the index field specified in _Source field_.

[[click-handlers]]
==== Click handlers

It is possible to define two different actions when clicking on a cell;

- Open an URL defined in the corresponding index field.
- Select an entity in an external datasource matching the corresponding index
field.

[[click-handlers-follow-url]]
==== Follow URL

Select the _Follow URL_ action to open a URL stored in an index field in a
new window.

For example, the following configuration defines an handler that opens the
URL stored in the field _homepage_url_ when clicking on the cell
displaying the _label_ field.

To configure a click handler, you must set the following parameters:

- _Column_ -- the name of the column to which the handler will be bound.
- _On click I want to_ -- the action to perform on click, select **Follow the URL** here.
- _URL field_ -- the name of the field containing the URL.
- _URL format_ -- a custom format string to compose the URL, where _@URL@_ is
replaced with the value of the field set in _URL field_.

_URL format_ can be used to create dynamic URL; the screenshot
below shows a configuration in which the value of the the _id_ field is
used to define the path of an URL on example.org.

With this configuration, if the _id_ field is set to 11 the resulting URL
will be _http://example.org/11_ .

[[click-handlers-select-entity]]
==== Select an entity

Select the _Select an entity_ action if you want to select an entity stored
in an external datasource matching the selected Elasticsearch document;
for more information about entity selection, please read the <<entity_selection>>
section.

To configure an entity selection action you must set the following parameters:

- _Column_ -- the name of the column to which the handler will be bound.
- _On click I want to_ -- the action to perform on click, select **Select the document** here.
- _Redirect to dashboard_ -- if set, clicking on the cell will select the
entity and display the specified dashboard.
