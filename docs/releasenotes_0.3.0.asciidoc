=== Kibi 0.3 and Kibana 4.4 Release Notes

==== Kibi Changes

* The 0.3 release of Kibi requires Elasticsearch 2.1.2.
* Using event times to create index names is no longer supported as of this release. Current versions of Elasticsearch include sophisticated date parsing APIs that Kibana uses to determine date information, removing the need to specify dates in the index pattern name.
