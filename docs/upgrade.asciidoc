[[upgrade]]
== Upgrading from a previous version

An existing Kibi installation can be upgraded as follows:

- backup the `.kibi` index.
- backup the `.kibiaccess` index if Kibi ACL is enabled.
- backup the Kibi configuration file (`config/kibi.yml`)
- {elastic-ref}setup-upgrade.html[upgrade Elasticsearch]; before restarting each node, make sure to install a compatible version of the
  {siren-join-website}#compatibility[SIREn Join] plugin.
- download and extract the new Kibi version.
- copy the previous configuration file to the `config` directory of the new Kibi version.
- check for breaking changes to the configuration described below.
- install the compatible versions of third party Kibi/Kibana plugins that you might need in addition to the bundled ones.
- execute the <<kibi-upgrade-command, upgrade command>>.

=== Breaking changes

==== 4.5.4

===== Enterprise Edition

If you are using Elastic Shield to secure the cluster that Kibi connects to,
ensure that the `kibi_core.elasticsearch.auth_plugin` parameter is set to
**shield**, e.g.:

[source,yaml]
----
kibi_core:
  elasticsearch:
    auth_plugin: "shield"
----

=== Backing up the .kibi index.

Before upgrading it is strongly recommended to have a backup of the `.kibi` index; the recommended way to perform regular backups of
Elasticsearch indexes is through the {elastic-ref}modules-snapshots.html[snapshot and restore modules].

If Kibi ACL is enabled, include the `.kibiaccess` index in the backup.

A useful tool to take a one-off backup is https://www.npmjs.com/package/elasticdump[elasticdump]; once installed, it is possible to dump
the `.kibi` index mappings and data on two separate files by running the following commands:

[source,shell]
----
elasticdump --input=http://<cluster address>:<cluster port>/<kibi index> --type=mapping --output=<mappings_dump_file>

elasticdump --input=http://<cluster address>:<cluster port>/<kibi index> --type=data --output=<data_dump_file>
----

Full example:

[source,shell]
----
$ elasticdump --input=http://192.168.99.100:9200/.kibi --type=mapping --output=mappings.json
$ elasticdump --input=http://192.168.99.100:9200/.kibi --type=data --output=data.json
----

If needed, you can restore the index from dumps by running the following commands:

[source,shell]
----
elasticdump --input=<mappings_dump_file> --type=mapping --output=http://<cluster address>:<cluster port>/<kibi index>

elasticdump --input=<data_file> --type=data --output=http://<cluster address>:<cluster port>/<kibi index>
----

Full example:

[source,shell]
----
$ elasticdump --input=mappings.json --type=mapping --output=http://192.168.99.100:9200/.kibi
$ elasticdump --input=data.json --type=data --output=http://192.168.99.100:9200/.kibi

[[kibi-upgrade-command]]
=== Upgrading the .kibi index.

To upgrade the objects in the `.kibi` index (dashboards, visualizations, etc.), move to the directory in which Kibi is installed and
execute the following command:

[source,shell]
----
bin/kibi upgrade
----

The command will look for out of date objects and upgrade them, e.g.:

[source,shell]
----
$ bin/kibi upgrade

It is possible to run the command multiple times, however running the command at the same time from multiple machines is not supported.
