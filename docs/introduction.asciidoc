== Introduction

Kibi is an open source data intelligence platform built upon
{kibana-announcement}[Kibana {kibana-version}]. +
Current Kibi v{kibi-version} support elasticsearch v{elasticsearch-version}
and Siren Join Plugin version v{siren-join-version}.


Kibi allows to perform complex analytics on large volumes of data by providing
customizable visualizations (charts, maps, metrics and tables) on Elasticsearch
queries; visualizations can be organized into multiple dashboards, presented
in a tabbed user interface.

Elasticsearch results can be filtered and augmented by queries on multiple
external datasources such as SQL databases and triplestores; queries on
external datasources can also be used as aggregations in visualizations.

In addition to standard Kibana visualizations, Kibi provides:

- The <<relational_filter, Relational Filter>> visualization, which allows
to configure relations between fields in different indices and apply
cross-dashboard filters (pivoting).

- The <<relational-panel, Relational Panel>>, which defines relations between indices by specifying on which fields to join. This enables to browse dashboards as a **connected** set, where filtering one dashboards updates results from the other dashboards.

- The <<wordcloud,Kibi Word Cloud>> visualization, which displays a cloud of
high frequency terms from the documents returned by an Elasticsearch query.

- The <<timeline,Kibi Timeline>> visualization, which displays a timeline
with multiple groups of data coming from different indices.

- The <<radar_chart,Radar Chart>> visualization, which is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_chart[graphical method] for displaying multivarate data.
with multiple groups of data coming from different indices.

- The <<bubble_diagram,Bubble Diagram>> visualization, which displays series of data grouped into packed circles.

- The <<kibi_scatter_plot,Scatter plot>> visualization, which displays a scatter plot chart in different modes.

- The <<kibi_box_plot,Box plot>> visualization, which displays a box plot chart from the data in the current set of Elasticsearch documents.

- The <<kibi_vector_map,Kibi Vector Map>> visualization, which displays a vector map where countries are colored based on aggregated field value.

- The <<kibi_horizontal_bar_chart,Kibi Horizontal Bar Chart>> visualization, which displays a horizontal bar chart.

- The <<kibi_multi_chart,Multi chart>> visualization, which displays a different type of charts for the same data
and allow save and select multiple aggregation configurations.

- The <<enhanced_search_results,Enhanced search results>> visualization, which
displays query results in a table.

- The <<kibi_query_viewer,Kibi Query Viewer>>, which enables the
visualization of queries on external datasource through Jade or Handlebars
templates.

- The <<graph_browser,Kibi Graph Browser>>, which displays the currently
selected Elasticsearch documents as a node of a graph and allows the user to visually
explore the connection between vertices.

The Relational Filter visualization requires the {siren-join-website}[Siren Join plugin {siren-join-version}] for
Elasticsearch. The plugin is compatible with Elasticsearch {siren-join-version}.

=== How does Kibi compare to Kibana?

Kibi is currently developed as a fork of Kibana {kibana-version}. The plugin API of https://www.elastic.co/blog/kibana-4-3-1-and-4-2-2-and-4-1-4[Kibana 4.2.x] allows us to keep the amount of forked code to a minimum, but as the API is currently in development, a fork is still needed.

=== What's new in Kibi v{kibi-version}

This new version of Kibi provides many improvements and new features.
