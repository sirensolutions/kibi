The Bubble Diagram visualization displays series of data grouped into packed circles.

==== Bubble size

The radius of circles depends on the type of metric aggregations.

*Count*:: The {elastic-ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-valuecount-aggregation.html[_count_] aggregation returns a raw count of
the elements in the selected index pattern.
*Average*:: This aggregation returns the {elastic-ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-avg-aggregation.html[_average_] of a numeric
field. Select a field from the drop-down.
*Sum*:: The {elastic-ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-sum-aggregation.html[_sum_] aggregation returns the total sum of a numeric
field. Select a field from the drop-down.
*Min*:: The {elastic-ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-min-aggregation.html[_min_] aggregation returns the minimum value of a
numeric field. Select a field from the drop-down.
*Max*:: The {elastic-ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-max-aggregation.html[_max_] aggregation returns the maximum value of a
numeric field. Select a field from the drop-down.
*Unique Count*:: The {elastic-ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-cardinality-aggregation.html[_cardinality_] aggregation returns
the number of unique values in a field. Select a field from the drop-down.

==== Buckets Aggregations

The _buckets_ aggregations determine what information will come out in the diagram.

You can do a maximum of two agregations at one time.
The first aggregation will create the parent circles, while the second aggregation will create the children circles.

Parent circles look slightly different than the children ones.
Parent circles have a thicker border and the label written in bold.

The parents bubble are divided by colors.
If you do a subaggregation (children) you will see a bubbles divided by family.
Children are located near the parent and all have the same color.
Families are united. If you drag a bubble, all members of the family will drag along.

==== Options

In the diagram there are three options

*Show Parents*:: If checked parent bubbles are visible when doing the the subaggregation.

*Hidden Label*:: If checked the labels are hidden.

*Enable Zoom*:: Enables zoom on the page. To use the zoom you have to use the mouse wheel.

==== Circles movements

All circles gravitates towards the center of the visualisation.

When you drag a circle, its family follows.

When you hover over a circle a detailed information is shown in a tooltip.

==== Filters

You can create filters by double-clicking on the bubbles.

When you double-click a child, you will the bubble itself and its parent.
