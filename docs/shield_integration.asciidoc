=== Installation

For detailed instructions on Shield installation and configuration options,
please refer to the {shield-ref}[Shield product documentation]; it is recommended
to enable SSL on the Elasticsearch HTTP interface.

=== Integrating Shield with Kibi

==== Installation

For detailed instruction on how to configure Shield with Kibi you can refer
to the {shield-ref}kibana.html[Using Kibana with Shield] documentation; make
sure to set the correct index name when configuring privileges for the
`kibana4-server` user, which is `.kibi` by default.

==== Transport client configuration

To allow the Kibi transport client to connect to an Elasticsearch cluster
secured with Shield, it is required to grant the
`cluster:monitor/nodes/liveness` to a specific user.

Once you created this user, specify its credentials in the
**kibi_core.elasticsearch.transport_client** section:

----
kibi_core:
  elasticsearch:
    transport_client:
      username: kibitransport
      password: password
----

Then, set the **kibi_core.elasticsearch.auth_plugin** option to **shield**:

----
kibi_core:
  elasticsearch:
    auth_plugin: "shield"
----
