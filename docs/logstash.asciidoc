== Loading data into Elasticsearch

This chapter contains basic information on how to load data into Elasticsearch
for evaluation purposes.

[float]
=== From a SQL database using Logstash

The indices in the Kibi demo distribution have been populated by running
four https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash[Logstash] configurations over
the SQLite database in `kibi/crunchbase.db`.

The database has the following schema:

==== Index setup

Before loading data, we need to setup indices and mappings; for
example, let's create an index called `company-minimal` in the Elasticsearch
cluster at `http://localhost:9220`.

Create the index by running the following command in a terminal window:

[source,bash]
curl -X PUT http://localhost:9220/company-minimal

If curl is not available on your system, please download it from
http://curl.haxx.se/download.html .

If the index is created correctly, Elasticsearch will return the following
response:

[source,json]
{"acknowledged":true}

If you want to destroy the index and start from scratch, execute the following
command:

[source,bash]
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:9220/company-minimal

==== Mapping definition

Mappings allow to configure how documents are stored in the index; for example,
they allow to define how fields are matched by the search engine and set their
type (string, dates, numbers, locations etc.).

NOTE: for detailed documentation about indices and mappings we recommend
reading the {elastic-ref}index.html[Elasticsearch Reference].

Let's define a simple mapping to describe a company; the mapping will define
the following fields:

- `id`: the id of the company in the SQLite database
- `name`: the name of the company
- `description`: a description of the company
- `homepage`: the URL of the company homepage
- `number_of_employees`: the number of employees
- `location`: the geographical coordinates of the company

Open a text editor and paste the following text:

[source,json]
----
{
    "CompanyMinimal": {
        "properties": {
            "id": {
                "index": "not_analyzed",
                "type": "string"
            },
            "number_of_employees": {
                "type": "long"
            },
            "name": {
                "index": "analyzed",
                "type": "string"
            },
            "description": {
                "index": "analyzed",
                "type": "string"
            },
            "homepage": {
                "index": "not_analyzed",
                "type": "string"
            },
            "location": {
                "geohash": true,
                "type": "geo_point"
            }
        }
    }
}
----


`CompanyMinimal` is the name of the mapping; `properties` contains the
indexing options for each field.

The `type` attribute specifies the field type; the example mapping contains
four strings, a number and a {elastic-ref}mapping-geo-point-type.html[geo_point],
which allows to perform geographically aware search queries.

The `index` attribute in each field definition is used to control how the
field will be handled by search engine; if set to `not_analyzed`, the search
engine will match a document only if its field value is equal to the value
set in the search query, if set to `analyzed` the field value will be processed
by an analyzer to allow full-text queries.

It is also possible to set the `index` attribute to `no` to make the search
engine ignore the field.

Save the file to `demo/sql/crunchbase/conf/logstash_sqlite/mappings/CompanyMinimal.mapping`
inside the directory where you extracted the demo distribution.

To apply the mapping, go to the `demo/sql/crunchbase/conf/logstash_sqlite`
directory and execute the following command:

[source,bash]
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:9220/company-minimal/_mapping/CompanyMinimal" -d "@mappings/CompanyMinimal.mapping"

If the mapping is created correctly, Elasticsearch will return the following
response:

[source,json]
-----
{"acknowledged":true}
-----

==== SQL query definition

To extract the values that will be loaded to the index by Logstash, we need to
write a SQL query; open a text editor and paste the following one:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT id,
  label AS name,
  description,
  homepage_url as homepage,
  number_of_employees,
  CASE WHEN lat IS NULL THEN
    NULL
  ELSE
    lat || ', ' || lng
  END AS location
  FROM company
  LEFT JOIN company_geolocation ON company.id = company_geolocation.companyid
----

Save the file to `demo/sql/crunchbase/conf/logstash_sqlite/company-minimal.sql`
inside the directory where you extracted the demo distribution.

[float]
==== Logstash configuration

We now need to write a Logstash configuration to process the records returned
by the query and populate the `company-minimal` index.

NOTE: support for SQL databases is provided by the
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-inputs-jdbc.html[Logstash jdbc input plugin];
the plugin comes pre-installed in the Logstash binary bundled in the demo.

Open a text editor and paste the following:

[source,text]
----
input {
  jdbc {
    jdbc_driver_library => "sqlitejdbc-v056.jar"
    jdbc_driver_class => "org.sqlite.JDBC"
    jdbc_connection_string => "jdbc:sqlite:crunchbase.db"
    jdbc_user => ""
    jdbc_password => ""
    statement_filepath => "company-minimal.sql"
    jdbc_paging_enabled => true
    jdbc_page_size => 10000
  }
}

filter {
  mutate {
    remove_field => ["@timestamp", "@version"]
  }
}

output {
  elasticsearch {
    host => "localhost"
    protocol => "http"
    port => 9220
    manage_template => false
    action => "index"
    index => "company-minimal"
    document_type => "CompanyMinimal"
  }
}
----

The `statement_filepath` parameter specifies the path to the file containing
the SQL query; the `jdbc_*` parameters set the database connection string and
authentication options.

The `mutate` filter is configured to remove default Logstash fields which
are not needed in the destination index.

The `output` section specifies the destination index; `manage_template` is
set to `false` as the index mapping has been explicitly defined in the
previous steps.

Save the file to `demo/sql/crunchbase/conf/logstash_sqlite/company-minimal.conf`
inside the directory where you extracted the demo distribution.

Copy the SQLite database to `demo/sql/crunchbase/conf/logstash_sqlite/crunchbase.db`,
then go to the `demo/sql/crunchbase/conf/logstash_sqlite` directory and run the
following command:

[source,bash]
----
../../../../../logstash/bin/logstash -f company-minimal.conf
----

Logstash will execute the query and populate the index.

NOTE: for more information about Logstash, we recommend reading the
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/index.html[Logstash reference]
and the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-inputs-jdbc.html[jdbc input plugin]
documentation.

==== Browsing the index in Kibi

Open {start-url} or for installation with Shield open {start-url-shield} in your browser,
click on the _Settings_ tab then on _Indices_ .

Deselect _Index contains time-based events_, then write `company-minimal` in
the _Index name or pattern_ field:

image::images/logstash/company-minimal-index.png["Adding the company-minimal index",align="center"]

Click on _Create_ to create the the index reference, then click on the
_Discover_ tab and select _company-minimal_ in the dark grey dropdown:

image::images/logstash/company-minimal-index.png["Discovering the company-minimal index",align="center"]

Click on the right arrow at the beginning of each row to expand it and see all
the loaded fields:

[float]
==== Demo distribution data loading script

The complete demo data loading process can be repeatead by running the
`demo/sql/bin/index_crunchbase_sqlite.sh` script; the script performs the
following actions:

- Creates a copy of the database in the directory containing Logstash
configurations
- Creates the indices `article`, `company`, `investor` and `investment`
- Sets the mappings for each index
- Runs the logstash configuration for each index

The Logstash configurations and Elasticsearch mappings are available in the
`demo/sql/crunchbase/conf/logstash_sqlite` directory.
