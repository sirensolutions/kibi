# Kibi 5.3.2

Kibi extends Kibana 5.3.2 with data intelligence features; the core feature of
Kibi is the capability to join and filter data from multiple Elasticsearch
indexes and from SQL/NOSQL data sources ("external queries").

In addition, Kibi provides UI features and visualizations like dashboard
groups, tabs, cross entity relational navigation buttons, an enhanced search
results table, analytical aggregators, HTML templates on query results, and
much more.

## Compatibility Table Kibi / Elasticsearch

### Kibi 5

Ideally, you should be running Elasticsearch and Kibana with matching version numbers. If your Elasticsearch has an older version number or a newer _major_ number than Kibana, then Kibana will fail to run. If Elasticsearch has a newer minor or patch number than Kibana, then the Kibana Server will log a warning.

_Note: The version numbers below are only examples, meant to illustrate the relationships between different types of version numbers._

| Situation                 | Example Kibana version     | Example ES version | Outcome |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- |------------------- | ------- |
| Versions are the same.    | 5.1.2                      | 5.1.2              | üíö OK      |
| ES patch number is newer. | 5.1.__2__                  | 5.1.__5__          | ‚ö†Ô∏è Logged warning      |
| ES minor number is newer. | 5.__1__.2                  | 5.__5__.0          | ‚ö†Ô∏è Logged warning      |
| ES major number is newer. | __5__.1.2                  | __6__.0.0          | üö´ Fatal error      |
