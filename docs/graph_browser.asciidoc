The Kibi Graph Browser http://siren.solutions/kibi-enterprise-edition-is-here-sneak-peak-and-webinar-invitation-3/[introduced in Kibi Enterprise Edition] displays the currently selected Elasticsearch documents as a node of a graph.

==== Configuration
To configure the visualization, set the *Source* and select:

 * *Datasource* - the Kibi Tinkerpop3 datasource to be used.

By default every node is assigned with an icon and a label. It is possible to customize the style of both of them.

===== Custom Icon

To configure an icon, add a new *Icon* and select:

 * *Index Pattern* - the index pattern containing the type of documents you want to configure
 * *Icon Type* - the type of icon you want to use
 ** *Font awesome* - the icon will be selected using the vector icons from https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/[Font Awesome]
 ** *Parameterized Relative Path* - the icon will be selected from the configured relative path. The relative path points to `<kibi_root>/installedPlugins/kibi_graph_browser_vis/public/icons/`. You can create subfolders to better organize your custom icons. If the icon filename is stored inside your document, you can use a parameterized relative path. Eg: `/set1/@[_doc][iconType]@.png` will be evaluated using the iconType field of the document.

 * *Index Pattern* - the index pattern containing the documents you want to configure
 * *Document type* - the type of documents you want to configure

==== Navigating the Graph

Once your Kibi Graph Browser visualization is ready, you can start exploring the graph. You have several operations available:

 * *Select Nodes* - you can select nodes by clicking and dragging a selection rectangle or by ctrl+click on elements to add them to the selection
 * *Add Filter* - a new filter will be added to Kibi representing the currently selected nodes
 * *Expand* - fetches new nodes and relations of the selected nodes
 * *Crop* - crops only the selected nodes, by removing all the other nodes
 * *Remove* - removes only the selected nodes, leaving all the others

Note: A filter added through the graph is pinned by default.

You can choose two different layouts for your graph:

 * *Standard* - This is the standard visualization. The Kibi Graph Browser will choose automatically the position of elements
 * *Hierarchy* - The graph will be displayed using a hierarchical structure, starting from the selected nodes
