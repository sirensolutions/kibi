== Kibi Scatter Plot

This visualization displays a scatter plot chart
in four different modes: _Straight_, _Significant terms_, _Any aggregator_, _Filtered aggregator_.

[float]
=== Straight
image::images/scatter_plot/straight_mode.png["Straight",align="center"]

This mode doesn't use aggregates, it pulls the data directly from Elasticsearch using the {elastic-ref}query-dsl-function-score-query.html[Random scoring method] to get a random sample of records.

 * *X values* - The value can be String, Date or Numeric. Select a field from the drop-down.
 * *Y values* - The field value can be String, Date or Numeric. Select a field from the drop-down.
 * *X axis label* - A label for the X axis.
 * *Y axis label* - A label for the Y axis.
 * *X axis scale* - You can select *linear*, *log*, or *square root* scales for the chart's X axis. You can use a log
scale to display data that varies exponentially, such as a compounding interest chart, or a square root scale to
regularize the display of data sets with variabilities that are themselves highly variable. This kind of data, where
the variability is itself variable over the domain being examined, is known as _heteroscedastic_ data. For example, if
a data set of height versus weight has a relatively narrow range of variability at the short end of height, but a wider
range at the taller end, the data set is heteroscedastic.
 * *Y axis scale* - You can select *linear*, *log*, or *square root* scales for the chart's Y axis.
 * *Jitter field* - Deterministic jitter to add pseudo random data distribution in the X axis data interval. Jitter is useful
for distributing the values across X axis. Doing so allows to show the data distributed across the bucket, in that way the dot is more visible.
 * *Jitter scale* - You can select *linear*, *log*, or *square root* scales for the Jitter.
 * *Label* - A label for the dot.
 ** *Display label* - Check this box to enable the display of a label next to the dot.
 ** *Label hover effect* - Check this box to enable the tooltip label.
 * *Color* - A color for the dot.
 * *Color field* - The field used as an input to generate the dot colors. Only number field types are allowed.
 * *Dot size* - A size for the dot.
 * *Dot size field* - The field used as an input for the dot size. Only number field types are allowed.
 * *Dot size scale* - You can select *linear*, *log*, or *square root* scales for the dot size.
 * *Size* - Number of random records to fetch from Eleasticsearch query.
 * *Shape opacity* - Value from 0 to 1 which defines the dot transparency.

[float]
=== Significant terms
image::images/scatter_plot/significant_terms_mode_5.png["Significant term",align="center"]

In this mode the chart is built from a _Significant terms_ aggregation query result.
The X values are taken from the *bg_count* field and the Y values from *doc_count* field.

 * *Field* - the field which will provide terms to be aggregated.
 * *Size* - the number of significant terms to be aggregated.
 * *X axis label* - A label for the X axis.
 * *Y axis label* - A label for the Y axis.
 * *Color* - A color for the dot.
 * *Shape opacity* - Value from 0 to 1 which defines the dot transparency.

[float]
=== Any aggregator
image::images/scatter_plot/any_aggregator_mode_5.png["Any aggregator",align="center"]

The chart is built from a _Date Histogram_, _Histogram_, _Terms_ or _Significant terms_ aggregation query result.

 * *Aggregation* - Select an aggregation from the drop-down list.
 * *X Metric* - X axis values. Select a metric from the drop-down list.
 * *Y Metric* - Y axis values. Select a metric from the drop-down list.
 * *Color* - A color for the dot.
 * *Dot size* - A size for the dot.
 * *Shape opacity* - Value from 0 to 1 which defines the dot transparency.

[float]
=== Filtered aggregator
image::images/scatter_plot/filtered_aggregator_mode_5.png["Filtered aggregator",align="center"]

The chart is built from a _Date Histogram_, _Histogram_, _Terms_ or _Significant terms_ aggregation query result.
The X and Y values are taken from _Filters_ aggregation results.

 * *Aggregation* - Select an aggregation from the drop-down list.
 * *Filter X* - A filter string for the X axis.
 * *Filter Y* - A filter string for the Y axis.
 * *Metric* - Metric to be calculated for each filter aggregation. Select a metric from the drop-down list.
 * *Color* - A color for the dot.
 * *Dot size* - A size for the dot.
 * *Shape opacity* - Value from 0 to 1 which defines the dot transparency.
